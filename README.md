Play: The Missing Tutorial &trade;
------

Last weekend(19-20 March 2016) I started learning [Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com/) as part of my [52 Technologies in 2016](https://github.com/shekhargulati/52-technologies-in-2016) blog series. Rather than writing about Play framework in one tutorial I decided to create a tutorial series(in a separate Github repository) so that I can focus on it individually. This repository will host both the content and sample application source code. This work is inspired by [The Flask Mega Tutorial](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) written by [Miguel Grinberg](https://twitter.com/miguelgrinberg). The Flask Mega Tutorial is very well written step by step introduction on how to build Python web applications using Flask framework.

Play Framework is not an easy framework to get started. You can very quickly get overwhelmed by its features and complexity. The goal of this tutorial is to help you build an application step by step so that you remain focussed and get most out of the Play framework.

**This tutorial will cover Play Scala framework version 2.5.0**

## Application

In this tutorial, we will build a blogging platform called `blogy` that you can use to write and publish blogs. To build this web application, we will cover topics mentioned below.

## Table of Contents

These are some of the topics I will cover as we make progress with this project:

* [Part 1: Hello World!](./01-hello-world.md)
* [Part 2: Templates](./02-templates.md)
